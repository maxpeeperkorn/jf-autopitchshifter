Description
-----------

PitchShifter is a simple live audio pitch shifter example application for desktop & iOS.

Made for [Golan Levin](http://flong.com) & the [CMU Studio for Creative Inquiry](http://studiofrocreativeinquiry.com)

It uses ofxPd & OpenFrameworks.

[ofxPd](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxPd) is an Open Frameworks addon for running an instance of the Pure Data audio environment within an OpenFrameworks application. Audio, messages, and [MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface) events can be passed to and from pure data patches and the library is thread safe.

[Pure Data](http://pure-data.info/) is a graphical patching environment for audio and multimedia (note: the gui and graphics features are not within the scope of this addon) 

[OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in C++
